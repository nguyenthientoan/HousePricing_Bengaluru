# HousePricing_Bengaluru
This project is for house prediction in Bengaluru which is a city in India. 

In this project, there are 2 things that will be broken down into 2 parts (cleaning and applying linear regression, decision tree)
In Part 1, I put the effort in finding missing, duplications, invalid data types, distribution of data, and outliers) since this task contributes to the success of the model. Moreover, I apply some techniques such as one-hot-encoding and some business mindset.

In part 2, I apply the method of linear regression with lasso to avoid overfitting and the decision tree. 

The result shows that the linear regression is better than others.
